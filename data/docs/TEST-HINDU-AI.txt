Hinduism is the world's oldest major religion, originating in the Indian subcontinent, encompassing diverse traditions often known as Sanatana Dharma (the eternal tradition) rather than a single religion. Key concepts include the belief in Brahman (the ultimate reality), karma (actions and their consequences), reincarnation (samsara), and the pursuit of dharma (righteous living) to achieve moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth). A core practice is the concept of Atman, the eternal soul, which eventually becomes one with Brahman.
